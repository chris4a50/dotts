## Dotfiles

Dotfiles for my current desktop. Arch Linux. 

Moving these up here in case something really does break. Excluding the 
desktop background, but everything else I can provide credit where due.

Seen some writings on wikis and forums and such that say there's better
ways to configure urxvt through non-.Xresources means but for now it'll
do. I'll clean it up when I read more and get smart about how to do it
right.

If I ever get around to meshing the Rofi theme with the current Polybar
pink theme, I'll send up the .rasi myself. Chances are good that the
text font in Polybar will get changed, too.
